<p><strong><font color="#800000" size="5">Iconic Franchise Features</font></strong></p>
<p>¨</p>
<p>The line between competitors and enemies can be razor 
thin in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and franchise members will often 
find themselves bumping heads with the members of other Acq Inc franchises. 
Things might even get rough sometimes. It's just business.</p>
<p>The following iconic features can be added to NPC or 
monster stat blocks to represent company positions similar to those of the 
characters. These features are inspired by the company positions in chapter 2 
but are intended only for quick use in combat encounters, and thus do not 
recreate all of a position's features in NPC form. DMs creating NPCs who have 
company positions can use additional position features from chapter 2 for those 
NPCs as desired.</p>
<p>Other factions such as the Six or Dran Enterprises have 
employees that take on company positions similar to those adopted by members of 
Acq Inc. These features can be used for members of those factions as well, 
either on their own or added to the faction features from the previous 
section.</p>
<p>A monster or NPC that has a company position always 
carries the special items granted by that position (a cartographer's spyglass of 
clairvoyance and cartographer's map case, a hoardsperson's living loot satchel, 
and so forth). As normal, these items do not function for anyone else, and will 
be actively sought out by the organization that owns them if they are lost or 
stolen.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Cartographer</font></strong><br/>The iconic cartographer makes a point of knowing 
the position of every member of their team, understanding the layout of their 
immediate area and the location of any exits or escape routes.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Acolyte, druid, guard, scout, spy 
(Monster Manual); archer (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Map of Shortcuts (1/Day). 
As an action, the cartographer produces a map from its cartographer's map case 
that shows useful shortcuts in the immediate area and then vanishes. Each 
creature of the cartographer's choice that can see the map can take the Dash or 
Disengage action as a bonus action on its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Decisionist</font></strong><br/>The iconic decisionist constantly polls allies 
and foes during the ongoing battle, getting a read on what everyone thinks, and 
then explaining how they're all completely wrong.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Bandit captain, knight, scout (Monster 
Manual); archer, enchanter (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Better Odds (1/Day). As 
an action, this creature flips its coin of decisionry to determine the best 
course of action, choosing a number of creatures that can see and hear it. Each 
of the target creatures (in addition to this creature) rolls a d4 and adds the 
number rolled to the next ability check, saving throw, or attack roll it 
makes.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Documancer</font></strong><br/>An iconic documancer acts with the authority of 
their organization. Documancers constantly speak in legalese, referencing 
obscure reasons why opponents will fail or should surrender.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Acolyte, mage, priest, veteran 
(Monster Manual); bard (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Scroll Service (1/Day). As 
an action, the documancer draws a spell scroll from its documancy satchel. The 
scroll contains a spell of up to 3rd level of the documancer's choice. Only the 
documancer can use the scroll, which vanishes after 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Hoardsperson</font></strong><br/>The iconic hoardsperson flaunts their wealth, 
knowing that foes are daunted by that which they have failed to earn.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Bandit captain, gladiator (Monster 
Manual); master thief, swashbuckler (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>That Thing You 
Need (3/Day). The hoardsperson pulls one item of its choice from the living loot 
satchel. This can be any item found on the Adventuring Gear table in chapter 5, 
"Equipment," of the Player's Handbook. The item must be worth no more than 15 
gp.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Loremonger</font></strong><br/>The iconic loremonger trades in information, even 
when locked down in battle. A loremonger constantly tries to goad foes into 
revealing plans and secrets.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Cult fanatic, druid, mage, priest 
(Monster Manual); bard, enchanter (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Whispered 
Encyclopedia (1/Day). When a visible creature within 20 feet of the loremonger 
makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the loremonger can 
use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Obviator</font></strong><br/>The iconic obviator sees foes as obstacles worthy of 
respect. Obviators engage in repartee, testing the minds and skills of their 
opponents as their own strategy is deployed.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Assassin, gladiator, priest (Monster 
Manual); martial arts adept, swashbuckler (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Read the 
Opposition (1/Day). As a bonus action, the obviator chooses one other creature 
it can see, then relays information about the target's tactics to all creatures 
that can hear this creature. Until the end of the target creature's next turn, 
attack rolls and contested ability checks made against the target are made with 
advantage.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Occultant</font></strong><br/>The iconic occultant believes that every action 
changes the world around them, requiring a proper reaction. Occultants attempt 
to inspire fear in their foes with dire prognostications and mysterious 
portents.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Berserker, druid, gladiator, knight, 
and tribal warrior (Monster Manual); diviner (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<br/>Bead 
of Instant Karma (1/Day). When a creature the occultant can see makes an attack 
roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the occultant can use its reaction to 
give its choice of advantage or disadvantage to the roll.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000"></font></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Iconic 
Secretarian</font></strong><br/>The iconic secretarian treats their foes like 
customers, offering deals they shouldn't refuse and inviting them to switch 
allegiances for greater profit and security.</p>
<p>Recommended NPCs: Acolyte, berserker, knight, noble, and 
priest (Monster Manual); bard, warlock of the archfey (Volo's Guide to 
Monsters)<br/>Charming Introduction (1/Day). As an action, the secretarian hands 
a business card from its portfolio keeper to a creature within 5 feet of it. The 
target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the 
secretarian, as if under the effect of the charm person spell.</p>
