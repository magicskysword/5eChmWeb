<p>Dwarves aren't known for eating their vegetables, but 
when the vegetables are drenched in a salty, golden batter and oil-fried until 
crisp, they can't get enough of them! Don't forget to finish these fried 
delights with a dousing of "golden sauce"—a syrupy, sweet confection laced with 
a citrus accent. This dish is particularly popular among surface dwarves who 
have greater access to fresh produce and root vegetables.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><strong><font color="#800000">4人份用料</font></strong><br/><strong>Sweet and Sour 
  Sauce：</strong><br/>1/3 cup apricot or peach jam or orange marmalade<br/>1/3 cup 
  ketchup<br/>3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br/>1 tablespoon light or dark brown 
  sugar<br/>2 teaspoons soy sauce<br/>1/2 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce 
  (optional)<br/>Kosher salt</p>
<p><strong>Tempura：</strong><br/>About 1又1/2 quarts canola 
  or other high-smoke-point oil for frying<br/>2/3 cup cake flour<br/>3 
  tablespoons all-purpose flour<br/>Kosher salt<br/>2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon 
  sparkling water, cold<br/>8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, very 
  large caps halved, cold<br/>1 sweet potato, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut 
  crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, cold<br/>1 yellow onion, trimmed, halved pole 
  to pole, and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slivers, cold</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>MAKE THE SAUCE.</strong> In a small saucepan 
over medium heat, warm the jam, stirring, until mostly fluid, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Add the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, chile-garlic sauce (if using), 
and 1/2 teaspoon salt and whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, 
whisking, to blend the flavors, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool to room 
temperature. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if 
necessary.<br/><strong>MAKE THE TEMPURA.</strong> Line a large, rimmed baking 
sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Clip a deep-fry or 
candy thermometer to the side of a heavy 5-quart Dutch oven, add the oil, and 
warm over medium-high heat to 390°F. Preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire 
rack on a second large, rimmed baking sheet and set aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl about one-third full with 
ice and about 1又1/2 cups water. In a medium (preferably stainless-steel) bowl 
that will fit in the larger bowl, whisk together the cake and all-purpose flours 
and 3/4 teaspoon salt; set this bowl in the bowl with the ice water to chill the 
flour mixture. When the oil reaches 390°F, add the sparkling water to the flour 
mixture and stir just until the wet and dry are incorporated, but still a little 
lumpy; do not overmix.</p>
<p>Working with about eight pieces at a time, use tongs or 
chopsticks to dip them in the batter to coat thoroughly. Allow any excess batter 
to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale 
gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent 
sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even 
frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or 
long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towelClined baking sheet to drain 
for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set 
on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover 
to 390°F and fry the remaining batches. Serve with the sweet and sour 
sauce.</p>
